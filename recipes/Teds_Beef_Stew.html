        There is never a bad time for this chicken parmesan sandwich! And when it’s as delicious as this, you’ll want it for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner!

        Chicken breast is breaded and pan fried so that it is wonderfully crispy, and each bite is super yummy! It’s an easy process, and it tastes amazing.
