        Delicious crispy shrimp coated in a bread crumb-Parmesan mixture. My family can't get enough of it! I would suggest doubling the recipe if you have very large eaters because this is addictive! Serve with pasta and salad.

        But it’s even better bathed in an herby sauce or tossed with garlic and nutty grated Parmesan as in today’s recipe.

        Chicken breast is breaded and pan fried so that it is wonderfully crispy, and each bite is super yummy! It’s an easy process, and it tastes amazing.
